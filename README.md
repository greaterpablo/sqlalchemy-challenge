In this excercise you could note how we can work on large databases
As a long holiday vacation planner in Honolulu, Hawaii i will give you some intersting insights:

1.-The average temperature is around 72°F with a max of 80°F and lowest 54° so I need special clothes for that
2.-There's a 4 seassons for raining so I need a umbrella!
3.-No all the weather is the same in the island, so we can tour some place in other.

Are raining is related with highest waves?
I'd like to surf in but i can only do it in 8 months!
